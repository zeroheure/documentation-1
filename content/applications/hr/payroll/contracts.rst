Contracts
=========

Every employee in Odoo is required to have a contract in order to be paid. A contract outlines the
terms of an employee's position, their compensation, their working hours, and any other details
about their position.

.. important::
   Contract documents (PDFs) are uploaded and organized using the *Documents* application, and are
   signed using the *Sign* application. Ensure these applications are installed in order to send and
   sign contracts. Please refer to the :doc:`/applications/finance/documents` and
   :doc:`/applications/finance/sign` documentation.

To view the employee contracts, go to the :menuselection:`Payroll app --> Contracts --> Contracts`
from the top menu. All employee contracts are displayed in a default list view, grouped in four
categories: :guilabel:`New`, :guilabel:`Running`, :guilabel:`Expired`, and :guilabel:`Cancelled`.

The default view has all categories collapsed. The number of contracts in each category is displayed
next to the category name (example: `Running (20)`). To view the list of contracts under any
category, click on the category and the list expands downward, showing all contracts beneath it.

.. note::
   The list of contracts in the *Payroll* application matches the list of contracts in the
   *Employees* application.

click the :guilabel:`New` button on the contract dashboard. A contract form appears where the
information can be entered.

Required fields

- :guilabel:`Contact Reference`: type in the name or title for the contract, such as `John Smith
  Contract`.

  then click on the :guilabel:`date`.
- :guilabel:`Working Schedule`: select one of the working schedules from the drop-down menu.

.. tip::
   The :guilabel:`Working Schedule` drop-down menu displays all the working schedules for the

   --> Configuration --> Working Schedules`. Click :guilabel:`New` and create a new working
   schedule, or click on an existing working schedule and make edits.

- :guilabel:`Work Entry Source`: select how the :doc:`work entries <../../hr/payroll/work_entries>`

    in the *Attendances* application. (This requires the *Attendances* application).

Optional fields
---------------

- :guilabel:`Employee`: name of the employee that the contract applies to.
- :guilabel:`Contract End Date`: if the contract has a specific end date, click the drop-down menu,
  navigate to the correct month and year with the :guilabel:`< > (arrow)` icons, then click on the
  :guilabel:`date`.
- :guilabel:`Salary Structure Type`: select one of the salary structure types from the drop-down

- :guilabel:`Job Position`: select the specific job position the contract applies to from the
  drop-down menu.

  .. note::
     If the selected :guilabel:`Job Position` has a contract template linked to it with a specific

     associated with that :guilabel:`Job Position`.

- :guilabel:`Wage on Payroll`: enter the monthly wage for the employee.
- :guilabel:`Contract Type`: choose either :guilabel:`Permanent`, :guilabel:`Temporary`,
  :guilabel:`Seasonal`, :guilabel:`Full-Time`, or :guilabel:`Part-Time` from the drop-down menu.

Salary information
------------------

This section is where the specific salary details are defined. This section is country-specific, so
depending on where the company is located, these fields may vary.

The following fields are universal and apply for all localizations:

- :guilabel:`Wage Type`: select either :guilabel:`Fixed Wage` or :guilabel:`Hourly Wage` from the
  drop-down menu.
- :guilabel:`Schedule Pay`: select how often the employee is paid using the drop-down menu. Options
  are :guilabel:`Annually`, :guilabel:`Semi-annually`, :guilabel:`Quarterly`,
  :guilabel:`Bi-monthly`, :guilabel:`Monthly`, :guilabel:`Semi-monthly`, :guilabel:`Bi-weekly`,
  :guilabel:`Weekly`, or :guilabel:`Daily`.
- :guilabel:`Wage`: enter the employee's gross wage. The metric for the :guilabel:`Wage` is based on
  what is selected for the :guilabel:`Schedule Pay`.

  .. example::
     If :guilabel:`Annually` is selected for the :guilabel:`Schedule Pay`, then the :guilabel:`Wage`
     field appears in a `$0.00/year` format. If the :guilabel:`Schedule Pay` is set to
     :guilabel:`Bi-weekly` then the :guilabel:`Wage` field appears in a `$0.00/two weeks` format.

- :guilabel:`Yearly Cost (Real)`: this field automatically updates after the :guilabel:`Schedule
  Pay` and :guilabel:`Wage` fields are entered. This amount is the total yearly cost for the
  employer. This field is able to be modified, however, if this is modified, the :guilabel:`Wage`
  field updates. Ensure both the :guilabel:`Wage` and :guilabel:`Yearly Cost (Real)` are correct if
  this field is modified.
- :guilabel:`Monthly Cost (Real)`: this field automatically updates after the :guilabel:`Schedule
  Pay` and :guilabel:`Wage` fields are entered. This amount is the total monthly cost for the
  employer. This field is not able to be modified, and is calculated based on the :guilabel:`Yearly
  Cost (Real)`.

Contract details
----------------

The contract details section allows for the addition and editing of a contract, and the ability to
send the contract to the employee for approval and signatures.

- :guilabel:`Contract Template`: select a pre-existing contract template from the drop-down menu.
  Contract templates are typically created through the configuration menu, and are stored in the
  *Documents* application.
- :guilabel:`HR Responsible`: select the person that is responsible for validating the contract
  from the drop-down menu. This field is required.
- :guilabel:`New Contract Document Template`: select a contract from the drop-down menu to be
  modified for this new employee contract. These documents are stored in the *Sign* application.
- :guilabel:`Contract Update Document Template`: select a contract from the drop-down menu if the
  employee has an existing contract that requires updating. These documents are stored in the *Sign*
  application.
- :guilabel:`Analytic Account`: select the account the contract affects from the drop-down menu. It
  is recommended to check with the accounting department to ensure the correct account is selected.
- :guilabel:`Part Time`: tick this box if the employee is working part-time. When active, two
  additional fields appear below it:

  - :guilabel:`% (Percentage)`: enter the percent of time the employee works as compared to a
    full-time employee.
  - :guilabel:`Standard Calendar`: select the working hours that a typical full-time worker uses
    from the drop-down menu.
  - :guilabel:`Part Time Work Entry Type`: select the work entry type that will generate the balance
    of a full-time working schedule.

    .. example::
       If a full-time employee works 40 hours a week, and the employee works 20, enter `50` in the
       :guilabel:`% (Percentage)` field (50% of 40 hours = 20 hours). The employee generates twenty
       (20) hours of work entries under the work entry type `part-time`, and another twenty (20)
       hours of work entries under the work entry type `generic time off`, for a total of forty (40)
       hours worth of work entries.

- :guilabel:`Notes`: the notes field is a text field where any notes for the employee contract are
  entered for future reference.

   :alt: Contract details in optional tabs for a new contract.

.. important::
   The :guilabel:`HR Responsible`, :guilabel:`New Contract Document Template` and
   :guilabel:`Contract Update Document Template` fields are only visible if the *Sign* application
   is installed, as well as the `hr_contract_salary` and `hr_contract_salary_payroll` :doc:`modules
   </applications/general/apps_modules>`. The *Sign* application is where the contract templates are
   stored, and is required in order for an employee to sign any contract.

Modifying a contract
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Hover over a contract template and an :guilabel:`External Link` button at the end of the line
appears. Click the :guilabel:`External Link` button to open the corresponding contract template and
make any changes. A pop-up window appears with all the contract details. Modify the fields for the
contract as needed.

.. image:: contracts/modify-contract.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Edit the details for the contract.

- :guilabel:`Tags`: select any tags associated with the contract from the drop-down menu. To create
  a new tag, type in the name for a new tag and click :guilabel:`Create "new tag"`.
- :guilabel:`Signed Document Workspace`: this is where the signatures are stored. Choose a
  pre-configured workspace or create a new one.
- :guilabel:`Signed Document Tags`: select or create any tags **only** associated with the *signed*
  contract as opposed to the original unsigned contract.
- :guilabel:`Redirect Link`: enter a redirect link for the employee to access the contract. A
  redirect link takes the user from one URL to another, in this case, to the newly updated contract
  specifically written for them.
- :guilabel:`Authorized Users`: select the person(s) that can sign the document.

Once the edits are complete, click the :guilabel:`Cloud with an up arrow (save manually)` button.

Personal documents
------------------

If any documents are needed to keep on file, add them in the :guilabel:`Personal Documents` tab.
Click the :guilabel:`Upload your file` button next to the corresponding document, navigate to the
file, then click :guilabel:`Open` to select the document and add it to the tab.

The documents that are available to add a file to are: an :guilabel:`Image`, :guilabel:`ID Card
Copy`, :guilabel:`Mobile Subscription Invoice`, :guilabel:`SIM Card Copy`, and :guilabel:`Internet
Subscription Invoice`.

Salary attachments
==================

Any automatic deductions or allocations for an employee, such as child support payments and wage
garnishments, are referred to as a *salary attachment*. Navigate to :menuselection:`Payroll app -->
Contracts -> Salary Attachments` to view a list of all the currently configured salary attachments.

Each salary attachment appears with all relevant details displayed. The :guilabel:`Status` for each
attachment is color coded in the far right column. Currently running salary attachments have a
:guilabel:`Status` of :guilabel:`Running`, and appear in green. Salary attachments which have been
paid in full and are no longer active have a :guilabel:`Status` of :guilabel:`Completed`, and appear
in blue. Cancelled salary attachments have a :guilabel:`Status` of :guilabel:`Cancelled` and appear
in red.

   :align: center
   :alt: A list view of all the salary attachments with their status displayed.

New salary attachment
---------------------

To create a new salary attachment, click :guilabel:`New` and a blank salary attachment form loads.
Enter the following information on the form:

- :guilabel:`Employees`: add the employee(s) the salary attachment applies to using the drop-down
  menu.

  .. tip::
     Multiple employees can be added if the salary attachment details are identical. After all
     employees are added, a :guilabel:`Create Individual Attachments` button appears at the top of
     the form.

     After the form is completed, click the :guilabel:`Create Individual Attachments` button to
     create separate salary attachments for each of the employees listed in this field.

     .. image:: contracts/individual-attachments.png
        :align: center
        :alt: The Create Individual Attachments button that appears after multiple employees are
              added to the Employees field.

     This is a time-saving tip so that separate salary attachments do not need to be created
     individually, but can be created in a batch using this method.

- :guilabel:`Description`: enter a description for the specific type of salary attachment.
- :guilabel:`Type`: select the type of salary attachment from the drop-down menu. The options listed
  come from the salary attachment types configured in the configuration menu.
- :guilabel:`Start Date`: enter the date the salary attachment begins. The first of the current
  month populates this field by default. Click on the date and a calendar appears. Navigate to the
  desired month and year by using the :guilabel:`< > (arrow)` icons, and click on the date to select
  it.
- :guilabel:`Estimated End Date`: this field only appears after the :guilabel:`Monthly Amount` field
  is populated, and if the :guilabel:`Type` is **not** set to :guilabel:`Child Support`. This date
  is when the salary attachment is predicted to end, and is automatically calculated once both the
  :guilabel:`Monthly Amount` and :guilabel:`Total Amount` fields are populated. This is calculated
  based on how much is required to be paid, and how much is paid towards that amount each month. If
  either the :guilabel:`Monthly Amount` or :guilabel:`Total Amount` changes, this field
  automatically updates. It is not possible to modify this field.
- :guilabel:`Document`: if any documents are needed for the salary attachment, click the
  :guilabel:`Upload your file` button and a file explorer appears. Navigate to the file(s) and click
  :guilabel:`Open` to select them and attach them to the form.
- :guilabel:`Monthly Amount`: enter the amount to be taken out of the paycheck each month for this
  salary attachment.
- :guilabel:`Total Amount`: enter the total amount that is to be paid in this field. If
  :guilabel:`Child Support` is selected for the :guilabel:`Type`, this field does not appear.

.. image:: contracts/garnishment.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Enter a new line for each type of garnishment.

.. important::
   When the total amount has been paid for the salary attachment, navigate to the individual salary
   attachment and click the :guilabel:`Mark as Completed` button at the top of the form. This
   changes the status to :guilabel:`Completed` and the garnishments are no longer taken out of the
   employee's paychecks.

Once a contract has been created and/or modified, the contract must be sent to the employee to be
accepted and signed.
