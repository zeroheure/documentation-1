Updating (IoT)
==============

Due to the complexity of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box, and virtual Windows :abbr:`IoT
(Internet of Things)` box, the term 'updating' can mean several different things.

The actual drivers can be updated, the core code on the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box can be
updated, and a new image can be flashed (physical :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box).

This document explores the various ways to update :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` boxes to ensure
smooth operation of :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box processes and devices.

Flashing the SD card on IoT box
===============================

.. important::
   This update does **not** apply to the Windows :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box (Odoo 16 and
   higher).

   To update the Windows :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)`, first, uninstall the previous version of
   the Odoo Windows program, and then reinstall it using the most up-to-date installation package.

   To begin the installation, navigate to the Odoo 16 or higher installation package for Enterprise
   or Community - Windows edition, at `Odoo’s download page <https://odoo.com/download>`_.

In some circumstances, the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box's micro SD Card may need to be
re-flashed with Etcher software to benefit from Odoo's latest :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` image
update.

This means the Odoo :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box software may need to be updated in
instances of a new :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box, or when a handler's update, and an update
from the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box home page, does not fix issues.

.. warning::
   It is often imperative to re-flash the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box's image after
   upgrading the Odoo database to a new version.

.. note::
   A computer with a micro SD card reader/adapter is **required** to re-flash the micro SD card.


Navigate to Balena's website, and download `Etcher <https://www.balena.io/>`_. It is a free,
open-source utility used for burning image files onto drives.

Click to `download <https://www.balena.io/etcher#download-etcher>`_. Install and launch the program
on the computer.

Then, download the latest IoT image from `nightly <http://nightly.odoo.com/master/iotbox/>`_ :
`iotbox-latest.zip`

This image is compatible with all supported versions of Odoo.

The images should be downloaded and extracted to a convenient file location.

After this step is complete, insert the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box's micro SD card into
the computer or reader. Open *Etcher*, and select :guilabel:`Flash from file`, then find and select
the image just downloaded and extracted. Next, select the drive the image should be burned to.

Lastly, click :guilabel:`Flash`, and wait for the process to finish.

.. tip::
   Balena's *Etcher* software also allows for the administrator to flash the :abbr:`SD (Secure
   Digital)` card from a :abbr:`URL (Uniform Resource Locator)`. To flash from a :abbr:`URL (Uniform
   Resource Locator)`, simply click :guilabel:`Flash from URL`, instead of :guilabel:`Flash from
   file`.

   Then, enter the following: `http://nightly.odoo.com/master/iotbox/iotbox-latest.zip`.

.. note::
   An alternative software for flashing the micro SD card is *Raspberry Pi Imager*. Download the
   *Raspberry Pi* software `here <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>`_.

Update from the IoT box home page
=================================

In the background, the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box uses a version of Odoo code to run and
connect to the Odoo database. This code may need to be updated in order for the :abbr:`IoT (Internet
of Things)` box to operate effectively. This operation should be completed on a routine basis, to
ensure the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` system and its processes stay up-to-date.

Go to the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box homepage by navigating to :menuselection:`IoT app -->
IoT Boxes`, and clicking on the :guilabel:`IP address` of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box.
Then, click on :guilabel:`Update` (next to the version number).

If a new version of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box image is available, an
:guilabel:`Upgrade to _xx.xx_` button appears at the bottom of the page. Click this button to
upgrade the unit, at which point the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box flashes itself to the
newer version. All of the previous configurations are then saved.

.. note::
   This process can take more than 30 minutes. Do **not** turn off, or unplug, the :abbr:`IoT
   (Internet of Things)` box, as it would leave it in an inconsistent state. This means the
   :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box needs to be re-flashed with a new image.

Handler (driver) update
=======================

There may be some instances where drivers or interfaces need to be updated for individual devices
(e.g. scales, measurement tools, etc.). The IoT handler's (drivers and interfaces) code can be
modified by syncing them with the configured server handler's code.

This can be helpful in instances where :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` devices (e.g. scales,
measurement tools, etc.) are not working properly with the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box.

For both the Windows :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` (Odoo 16 and higher) and physical :abbr:`IoT
(Internet of Things)` box, this process can be performed manually from the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of
Things)` box homepage. Go to the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box homepage by navigating to
:menuselection:`IoT app --> IoT Boxes`, and clicking on the :guilabel:`IP address` of the :abbr:`IoT
(Internet of Things)` box.

Next, click :guilabel:`Handlers list`, and then select :guilabel:`Load Handlers` at the bottom of
the page.

.. important::
   Handler's code is fetched from the configured server, and it needs to be up-to-date to have the
   latest fixes and patches.

.. note::
   A handler update is also performed automatically each time the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)`
   box is restarted. The only exception to this process is if the :guilabel:`Automatic drivers
   update` is unchecked in the form view of the :abbr:`IoT (Internet of Things)` box on the Odoo
   server. This setting can be reached by going to :menuselection:`IoT App --> Select the IoT box
   --> Automatic drivers update`.
