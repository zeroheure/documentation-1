At confirmation reservation
===========================

The *At Confirmation* reservation method reserves products **only** when a sales order (SO) is
confirmed, **and** if enough stock of the products included in the :abbr:`SO (sales order)` is
already available.

Workflow
========

To see the *At Confirmation* reservation method in action, create a new :abbr:`SO (sales order)` by
navigating to :menuselection:`Sales app --> New`.

Add a customer in the :guilabel:`Customer` field, then, in the :guilabel:`Order Lines` tab, click
:guilabel:`Add a product`, and select a product to add to the quotation from the drop-down menu.
Finally, in the :guilabel:`Quantity` column, adjust the desired quantity of the product to sell.

Once ready, click :guilabel:`Confirm` to confirm the sales order.

Click the green :guilabel:`forecast graph` icon on the product line to reveal the product's
:guilabel:`Availability` tooltip. This tooltip reveals the reserved number of units for this order,
which, in this case, is `100 Units`.

.. admonition:: Forecasted Report

   To see all the factors that affect product reservation, click the :guilabel:`View Forecast`
   internal link arrow to view the :guilabel:`Forecasted Report` page.

   The :guilabel:`Forecasted Report` displays forecast information about the product(s) included in
   the sales order; namely, any live receipts of the product, and any active sales orders, listed in
   the :guilabel:`Used By` column. See how each order will be fulfilled in the
   :guilabel:`Replenishment` column.

   Additionally, the :guilabel:`Forecasted` quantity is calculated at the top of the page, by adding
   the **On Hand** and **Incoming** quantity, and subtracting the **Outgoing** quantity, as shown
   below:

   If one order should be prioritized over another order, click the :guilabel:`Unreserve` button on
   the according order line in the :guilabel:`Replenishment` column.

To deliver the products, click the :guilabel:`Delivery` smart button at the top of the sales order
form. To confirm that the reservation worked properly, ensure that the :guilabel:`Product
Availability` field reads `Available` (in green text), and the number in the :guilabel:`Demand` and
:guilabel:`Quantity` columns match (in this case, both should read `100.00`).
